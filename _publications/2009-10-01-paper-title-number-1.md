title: "Electricity price forecasting on the day-ahead market using machine learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/EPF
excerpt: 'The price of electricity on the European market is very volatile. This is due both to its mode of production by different
sources, each with its own constraints (volume of production, dependence on the weather, or production inertia), and by
the difficulty of its storage. Being able to predict the prices of the next day is an important issue, to allow the development
of intelligent uses of electricity. In this article, we investigate the capabilities of different machine learning techniques to
accurately predict electricity prices. Specifically, we extend current state-of-the-art approaches by considering previously
unused predictive features such as price histories of neighboring countries. We show that these features significantly
improve the quality of forecasts, even in the current period when sudden changes are occurring. We also develop an
analysis of the contribution of the different features in model prediction using Shap values, in order to shed light on how
models make their prediction and to build user confidence in models'
