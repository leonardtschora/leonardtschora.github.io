# About Me

My interest towards Artificial Intelligence started through Machine Learning classes, back in my engineering school at the INSA Rouen where I choose to specialize in Computer Sciences and Information Systems. This was confirmed by a semester abroad in the University of Queensland and a research internship at Merck, Germany, where I studied and worked on a new approach to Artificial Neural Networks : Neocortical Algorithms.

This was followed by another internship at BCMEnergy in Lyon, where I worked on Machine Learning Techniques for Electricity Price Forecasting. Given the depth of the subject and my interest towards it, I was able to pursue my research as a PhD at the INSA Lyon. 

At the LIRIS laboratory, I developed innovative methods that led to several contributions in high-ranked journals, as well as the participation to international conferences. Specifically, my study of the interactions between Machine Learning an Optimization Problems applied to Graphs won the Frontier Prize for best paper award at the International Data Analysis 2023 conference.

At the same time, I applied the newly developed methods to the European Day-Ahead Power Markets. I contributed to the translation of my research into tools usable by BCMEnergy's trading team. Three years and a half later, I defended my PhD in front of a cutting-edge jury and got the grade of PhD in Informatics.

I am looking to expand my professional horizons. Given my passion for research, I would always be disposed to work on a subject that requires developing new AI methods. Paradoxically, I feel the need or completing my competences by orienting on the Integration part of a ML project (MLOps).

Lastly, I want to be confronted to new ideas and new working methods. This is why I am looking for an in-site job in the U.S.
