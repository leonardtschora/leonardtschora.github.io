About Me

# About Me

My journey in **Artificial Intelligence** began with a deep fascination for **Machine Learning** during my studies at INSA Rouen, where I specialized in **Computer Sciences** and **Information Systems**. This passion was further solidified during a semester abroad at the University of Queensland and a research internship at Merck, where I applied advanced **ML techniques** to real-world problems.

My career took a pivotal turn during an internship at Elmy in Lyon, where I worked extensively on **Machine Learning** techniques for **electricity price forecasting**. This experience sparked my deep interest in the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Electricity Markets**, leading me to pursue a Ph.D. at INSA Lyon (LIRIS laboratory), one of France's top research institutions.

At the LIRIS laboratory—part of the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS), France's leading research organization—I developed innovative **predictive models** and methods that contributed to significant advancements in the field. My work on the interaction between **Machine Learning** and **Optimization Problems** applied to **Graphs** was recognized with the **Frontier Prize** for the best paper at the International Data Analysis 2023 conference.

During my Ph.D., I applied these predictive models to the **European Day-Ahead Power Markets**, transforming cutting-edge research into practical tools for Elmy’s trading team. This hands-on experience in the **electricity markets** industry has equipped me with a unique blend of research and practical application skills.

As I look to expand my professional horizons, I am passionate about continuing my work in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**, with a particular focus on integrating ML projects into operational environments (MLOps). I am eager to explore new opportunities that challenge me to innovate and apply my expertise in **Python* and other tools to solve complex problems.

Given my interest in staying at the forefront of innovation, I am particularly drawn to the vibrant academic and technological environment of the Boston area. Proximity to leading institutions like Harvard and MIT, which are at the cutting edge of **Artificial Intelligence** research, makes this an ideal location for my next career step.
