# About Me

My interest towards Artificial Intelligence started through Machine Learning classes, during my engineering school at the INSA Rouen where I chose to specialize in Computer Sciences and Information Systems. After a semester abroad in the University of Queensland and a research internship at Merck, this vocation was confirmed!

I finished my studies with an internship at Elmy in Lyon, where I worked on Machine Learning techniques for electricity price forecasting. Given the depth of the subject and my keen interest in it, I was able to pursue my research as a Ph.D. at the INSA Lyon (LIRIS laboratory). 

The LIRIS laboratory is part of the National Center of Scientific Research (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique CNRS), the ranked 1 research lab in France. There, I developed innovative methods that led to several contributions in high-ranked journals, as well as the participation to international conferences. Specifically, my study of the interactions between Machine Learning and Optimization Problems applied to Graphs won the Frontier Prize for best paper award at the International Data Analysis 2023 conference.

At the same time, I applied the newly developed methods to the European Day-Ahead Power Markets. I contributed to the translation of my research into tools usable by BCMEnergy's trading team. Three years and a half later, I defended my Ph.D. in front of a cutting-edge jury and earned a PhD in Computer Sciences.

I am looking to expand my professional horizons. Given my passion for research, I would always be disposed to working on a subject that requires developing innovative AI methodologies. Paradoxically, I feel the need to complete my competencies by focusing on the integration aspect of a ML project (MLOps).

Lastly, I want to be exposed to new ideas and new working methods. The University of Harvard and MIT have tremendously contributed to the Artificial Intelligence research. I believe that proximity to such centers of academic excellence encourages surrounding companies to pursue innovation and achieve excellence in this field. Given these advantages, I am seeking an on-site position in the Boston area.
